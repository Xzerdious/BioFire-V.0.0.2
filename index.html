<p>This is a terraria mod that's going to be mixed in with starbound kinda like a cross over, some music will be new and mine, new items,new enemies, new bosses, temples... You know what? multiple cross overs! lol jk copyright I'm going to have to ask the devs of starBound and terraria if I can do this. Planning to release the demo in 2017 full mod release is not planned yet. I may not even release the demo because this doesn't have very many stars on GitHub so if it gets to 58 stars then I wIll release the demo... once its finished of course. Phakathi izinhlamvu böyük, ikhodi ziyakuma. (Ka nav jēgas)  ;)</p>

<pre><code> Bellator, “ Tious, look out!” *Bellator jumps in the way of the spear* Tious, “BELLATOR!!” *Tious quickly rushes towards Bellator* Zerta, “ Puny mortals! Always questioning the power of a god!” Tious, “ I WILL NOT FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!” *A red aura starts to appear around Tious and his eyes turn white* Zerta, “ What’s this?!” *Tious charges towards Zerta*. Tious, “ I’LL KILL YOU” *Tious attacks Zerta multiple times with the dark sky raging and volcanos’ erupting* Zerta, “ Agh! ACK!” Tious, “ TAKE THIS” * Tious takes both of his hands to charge up his attack* Tious, “ HAAAAAA!” Zerta, “ NO THIS CAN’T BE HOW CAN A GOD GET DEFEATED BY A MORTAL?! AHHHH!” *Tious now out of breath falls to the hard stone floor that is below him*. Tious, “ I *huff* did it *huff* for us, Bellator… *Looks at Bellator* for all of us *Looks at all of his dead best friends* *huff* for the world…” Tious bloody and torn up slowly closes his eyes and smiles because he saved the world from destruction… but he could not save himself or his friends... or did he save one? *Bellator opens her eyes*
