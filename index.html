<p>This is a platform game fulled to the Brim with adventure and heart ship. I may not even release the demo because this doesn't have very many stars on GitHub so if it gets to 58 stars then I wIll release the demo... once its finished of course.

<pre><code>                        Chapter One: A new Beginning
 Our story starts out in a magical forest unseen by those who don’t know their way of a true hero speaking of hero 
</code></pre>

<p>this is where Bellator’s Journey shall begin. A humble town where birds are chirping, flowers are blooming, and 
everyone is having a good time, we now go to an old shack made out of wood and metal. Tious, “Hey! Bellator wake up!” 
<em>Bellator slowly opens and closes his eyes</em> <em>Tious drags Bellator out of her bed and looks at her whilst she lays on
 the floor</em> Tious, “ Morning sunshine” Bellator, “ What did I tell you about dragging me out of bed?!” Tious, “ . . .
 I can do whatever I want because you’re not the boss of me!”. Bellator, “ The hell I am!” Tious, “ C’mon clean 
yourself up and get outside! We have work to do!” Bellator gets up and takes a shower. Bellator finishes taking a shower and puts her clothes back on and goes outside to begin her work, Tious "Its about time! I almost died of old age!", Bellator, "Don't be such a drama queen you idiot you're only 26! and you are the one whom needs to take a shower you filthy piece of sh-" Tious, "WOAH!! Keep it PG!", Bellator "**** you I do what I want!".</p>
