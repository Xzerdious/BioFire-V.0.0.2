Our story starts out in a magical forest unseen by those who don’t know their way of a true hero speaking of hero this is where 
Bellator’s Journey shall begin. A humble town where birds are chirping, flowers are blooming, and everyone is having a good time, 
we now go to an old shack made out of wood and metal. Tious, “Hey! Bellator wake up!” * Bellator slowly opens and closes her eyes* 
*Tious drags Bellator out of her bed and looks at her whilst she lays on the floor* Tious, “ Morning sunshine” Bellator, “ What did
I tell you about dragging me out of bed?!” Tious, “ . . . I can do whatever I want because you’re not the boss of me!”. Bellator,
"The hell I am!” Tious, “ C’mon clean yourself up and get outside! We have work to do!” Bellator gets up and takes a shower.
Bellator finishes taking a shower and puts her clothes back on and goes outside to begin her work, Tious "It's about time! I almost 
died of old age!", Bellator, "Don't be such a drama queen you idiot you're only 26! and you are the one who needs to take a shower
you filthy piece of sh-" Tious, "WOAH!! Keep it PG!", Bellator "**** you I do what I want!".

#How the story would have ended (No relation)

Bellator, “ Tious, look out!” *Bellator jumps in the way of the spear* Tious, “BELLATOR!!” *Tious quickly rushes towards Bellator* 
Zerta, “ Puny mortals! Always questioning the power of a god!” Tious, “ I WILL NOT FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!” *A red aura starts to 
appear around Tious and his eyes turn white* Zerta, “ What’s this?!” *Tious charges towards Zerta*. Tious, “ I’LL KILL YOU” *Tious 
attacks Zerta multiple times with the dark sky raging and volcanos’ erupting* Zerta, “ Agh! ACK!” Tious, “ TAKE THIS” * Tious takes
both of his hands to charge up his attack* Tious, “ HAAAAAA!” Zerta, “ NO THIS CAN’T BE HOW CAN A GOD GET DEFEATED BY A MORTAL?! 
AHHHH!” *Tious now out of breath falls to the hard stone floor that is below him*. Tious, “ I *huff* did it *huff* for us, Bellator
… *Looks at Bellator* for all of us *Looks at all of his dead best friends* *huff* for the world…” Tious bloody and torn up slowly 
closes his eyes and smiles because he saved the world from destruction… but he could not save himself or his friends. *Bellator 
opens her eyes*.
