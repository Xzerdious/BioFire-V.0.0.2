Our story starts out in a magical forest unseen by those who don’t know their way of a true hero speaking of hero this is where 
Bellator’s Journey shall begin. A humble town where birds are chirping, flowers are blooming, and everyone is having a good time, 
we now go to an old shack made out of wood and metal. Tious, “Hey! Bellator wake up!” * Bellator slowly opens and closes her eyes* 
*Tious drags Bellator out of her bed and looks at her whilst she lays on the floor* Tious, “ Morning sunshine” Bellator, “ What did
I tell you about dragging me out of bed?!” Tious, “ . . . I can do whatever I want because you’re not the boss of me!”. Bellator,
"The hell I am!” Tious, “ C’mon clean yourself up and get outside! We have work to do!” Bellator gets up and takes a shower.
Bellator finishes taking a shower and puts her clothes back on and goes outside to begin her work, Tious "It's about time! I almost 
died of old age!", Bellator, "Don't be such a drama queen you idiot you're only 26! and you are the one whom needs to take a shower
you filthy piece of sh-" Tious, "WOAH!! Keep it PG!", Bellator "**** you I do what I want!".
