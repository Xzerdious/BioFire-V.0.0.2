  "body": "### Welcome to The Legend of the BioFire: Bellator's Journey\r\nThis is a terraria mod that's going to be mixed in with starbound kinda like a cross over, some music will be new and mine, new items,new enemies, new bosses, temples... You know what? multiple cross overs! lol jk copyright I'm going to have to ask the devs of starBound and terraria if I can do this. Planning to release the demo in 2018 full mod release is not planned yet. I may not even release the demo because this doesn't have very many stars on GitHub so if it gets to 58 stars then I wIll release the demo... once its finished of course.

A humble town where birds are chirping, flowers are blooming, and \r\neveryone is having a good time, we now go to an old shack made out of wood and metal. Tious, “Hey! Bellator wake up!” \r\n*Bellator slowly opens and closes his eyes* *Tious drags Bellator out of her bed and looks at her whilst she lays on\r\n the floor* Tious, “ Morning sunshine” Bellator, “ What did I tell you about dragging me out of bed?!” Tious, “ . . .\r\n I can do whatever I want because you’re not the boss of me!”. Bellator, “ The hell I am!” Tious, “ C’mon clean \r\nyourself up and get outside! We have work to do!” Bellator gets up and takes a shower. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Version \r\nV.0.0.4\r\n\r\n### Creator and Contributors\r\nCreator is xZerdious.
