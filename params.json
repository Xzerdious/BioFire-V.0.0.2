You know what? Multiple cross overs! lol jk copyright I'm going to have to ask the devs of Starbound and Terraria if I can do this. Planning to release the demo in 2017 full mod release is not planned yet. I may not even release the demo because this doesn't have very many stars on GitHub so if it gets to 58 stars then I will release the demo... once it's finished of course.\r\n\r\n### Demo Version(s) (2017 March, 25) Planning on that date\r\n\r\n\r\n### Summary (Coming Soon)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Version\r\nV.0.0.3\r\n\r\n### Creator and Contributors\r\nCreator is Xzerdious.
