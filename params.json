I'm Also using images from other games and pictures as fillers at the time being these include; Terraria, Deviantart users (I don't know their names, all I saw was \"Deviantart\" so if you do know who drew it please let me know) and Google. Please be aware that when the full game is released all of these sprites will be erased and I will make my own on piskels. Also not all of the sprites that you see are not all fillers, some of them are mine and I'm making new piskels by day and night.\r\n\r\n### Demo Version(s) (2017 March, 25) Planning on that date\r\n\r\n\r\n### Summary (Coming Soon)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Version\r\nV.0.0.2\r\n\r\n### Author and Contributors\r\nAuthor is Xzerdious.
